# Install

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moldcraft/colour-scheme/master/sublime-text/moldcraft.tmTheme) the file

    `Right Click` -> `Save As`
* Copy the file in packages directory

    You can find it by using the `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages...` menu
* Enable the scheme

    Go to menu `Preferences` -> `Color Scheme` -> `moldcraft`

# To Do

* Try to get characters `()[]` (and `{}`?) to be a slight grey rather than white or whatever

# Can't Do

* Highlighting parameters differently to local variables
  * at best in the function declaration, [not throughout](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=11632), so no point
